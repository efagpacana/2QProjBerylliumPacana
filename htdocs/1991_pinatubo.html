    <h3> The 1991 Pinatubo Eruption </h3>

    <div class="info">

    <h5> Background on Pinatubo Volcano </h5>

    <p> It is a stratovolcano located in Western Luzon in the Philippines. Up until this eruption, it did not erupt for 500 years. </p>

    <h5> Info on the Eruption </h5>

    <p> 
        In 1990, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck near the Mount Pinatubo area. This caused a landslide and slight increases in 
        steam coming out of Pinatubo. It looked like Mount Pinatubo would continue its drought, but on March and April 1991, magma
        started coming out of the volcano. It caused earthquakes and major steam emissions. Throughout April, May and June, these earthquakes
        would continue and toxic sulfur dioxide gas was also emitted.
    </p>


    <p>
        At first, it did not look like it would be a violent eruption. On July 7, magma was slowly coming out of the volcano but it didn't look
        like it was anything serious. However, this changed 5 days later. Magma reached the surface and exploded in the volcano's first eruption
        in 500 years, but the volcano was not done. 3 days later, on July 15, the volcano had an eruption that reached up to 1 cubic mile. An ash
        cloud, which was blown in all directions by a typhoon happening at the same time, was also formed because of this eruption. Volcanic ash and lapili,
        which are rock fragments, covered the countryside. 
    </p>

    <h5> Effects and Aftermath of the Eruption </h5>
    
    <p> 
        Around 700 people died due to this eruption. Half of those came in the actual eruption, mostly through collapsing roofs. The other half died
        through disease that spread in evacuation camps. THis tragedy also left 200,000 people homeless. This also cost a lot of many in damage. It cost an estimated 
        700 million dollars in damage.

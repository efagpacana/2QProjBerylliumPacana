    <h3> Safety Measures in case of a Volcanic Eruption </h3>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
    There is no doubt that a volcanic eruption can be one of the most lethal natural disasters simply because of its unpredictability. Sometimes, it is too late to prepare for one
    because the eruption is sudden. However, there are still times you can take precaution because it was caught early. Here are some measures and precautions you can take in case you
    are in the area of an eruption.
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li> If lava flow is heading towards you, evacuate immediately. </li>
    <li> If you can use a vehicle, use one to get away from the lava faster. </li>
    </ul>

    <h5> Indoors </h5>
    <ul> 
    <li> Close all openings in your house like windows or doors. </li>
    <li> Turn off ventilation to avoid the spread of air. </li>
    </ul>

    <h5> Outdoors </h5>
    <ul>
    <li> Seek shelter. </li> 
    <li> Take care of burns immeadiately. </li>
    <li> If you get irritated by the volcanic gases, move away from the area. Consult your doctor if you are still feeling symptoms </li>
    </ul>

    <h5> Protection against Ashfall </h5>
    <ul>
    <li> As much as possible, stay indoors. </li>
    <li> If you need to go outdoors, make sure your whole body is covered. Wear pants and a long-sleeved shirt. </li>
    <li> Wear goggles and mask as protection for your face </li>
    </ul>

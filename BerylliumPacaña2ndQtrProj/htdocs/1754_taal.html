    <h3> The 1754 Taal Eruption </h3>

    <div class="info">

    <h5> Background on Taal Volcano </h5>

    <p> 
        The Taal Volcano is located in Batangas, Philippines. It is known to be one of the most active
        and dangerous volcanoes in the Philippines. It is also known to have beautiful scenery, with a 
        lake in the middle of it. 
    </p>

    <h5> Info on the Eruption </h5>

    <p>
        The volcano belched a lot of fire and smoke. It also ejected so much lava that
        the water in the lake was the only thing stopping people from getting burnt. Because
        of this, the people of Taal had to abandon their town. This eruption lasted for a 
        grueling 6 months. 
    </p>

    <h5> Effects and Aftermath of Eruption </h5>

    <p>
        The death tally went to 6,000 people. 4 towns were completely buried by debris. Ashfall that was up to
        40 inches deep was also reported.However, this wasn't the biggest effect of this eruption on Taal. 
        Before this eruption, Taal was considered the capital of Batangas, then this eruption happened. Because
        of the people having to abandon Taal, the capital city now went to Batangas City, which is what it is today.

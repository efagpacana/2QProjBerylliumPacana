    <h3> The 1814 Mayon Eruption </h3>

    <div class="info">

    <h5> Background on Mayon Eruption</h5>

    <p>
        The Mayon Volcano is an active stratovolcano located in the City of Legazpi. It is best known for its
        perfect cone shape.
    </p>

    <h5> Info on the Eruption </h5>

    <p>
        This volcano is known to be active but the eruption were relatively small. However, this eruption would be different.
        According to eyewitness, the volcano suddenly poured a thick column of rocks, sand and ashes. The volcano was covered
        and it could not be seen. A river of fire also came up and threatened to kill the people in the nearby villages. A few
        hours later, the rain of stones was replaced by a rain of sand. In a few hours, the sky began clearing up.
    </p>

    <h5> Effects and Aftermath of Eruption </h5>

    <p>
        This eruption caused a whopping 12,000 casualties. Materials such as hot rocks, ashes and sand poured from the crater.
        This set the villages around it on fire, killing everyone in it. Those who survived also weren't so lucky, as they were
        left homeless. 5 towns were completely destroyed. The beatiful scenery of Camarines was now destroyed, now covered in sand
        and ash.
